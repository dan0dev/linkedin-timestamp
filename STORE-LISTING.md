Extract precise timestamps from LinkedIn posts and comments. Replaces vague "2h ago" with exact dates and times automatically.

---

## Detailed Description

**Stop guessing when LinkedIn posts were actually published!**

LinkedIn shows vague relative times like "2h ago", "1d ago", or "3w ago" - making it impossible to know exactly when something was posted. This extension reveals the **precise timestamp** hidden in every LinkedIn post and comment.

### 🎯 What It Does

Automatically replaces LinkedIn's relative timestamps with **exact dates and times**:

**Before:** "2h ago"
**After:** "01/13/2026, 1:32:45 PM (2 hours ago)"

### ✨ Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Works instantly on all LinkedIn posts and comments
- **Comments Support**: Shows exact timestamps for comment threads with time differences from the original post
- **Smart Localization**: Automatically detects your timezone and language preferences
- **Dark Mode Compatible**: Seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn's dark mode
- **Manual Tool Included**: Extension popup lets you extract timestamps from any LinkedIn URL
- **Privacy First**: Zero data collection - all processing happens locally in your browser
- **Lightweight**: No performance impact on LinkedIn browsing

### 🔧 How It Works

LinkedIn uses "Snowflake IDs" - special numerical identifiers that encode the timestamp when the post was created. This extension:

1. Extracts the post/comment ID from LinkedIn pages
2. Decodes the embedded timestamp using mathematical operations
3. Formats the date according to your locale settings
4. Displays it right where the relative time used to be

### 💡 Perfect For

- **Researchers** tracking when content was published
- **Journalists** verifying post timing for fact-checking
- **Marketers** analyzing posting schedules and engagement timing
- **Investigators** requiring precise timestamps for documentation
- **Content Creators** studying optimal posting times
- **Anyone** who needs exact dates instead of vague "X ago" times

### 🌍 Localization

The extension automatically detects your:
- Browser language preferences
- System timezone
- Regional date formats

Supports all locale formats including:
- Hungarian: `2026. 01. 13. 13:32:45`
- US English: `01/13/2026, 1:32:45 PM`
- UK English: `13/01/2026, 13:32:45`
- And many more...

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **No data collection** whatsoever
- **No external requests** - everything runs locally
- **No tracking or analytics**
- **Open source** - code available for review
- **Minimal permissions** - only reads LinkedIn pages you visit
