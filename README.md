## 🤔 The Problem

LinkedIn shows you:
```
"Posted 2h ago"
"3d ago"
"1w ago"
```

**But you need to know:**
- Did they post this before or after the news broke?
- Was this comment immediate or came days later?
- What's the exact timeline of this conversation?

**LinkedIn hides the truth. We reveal it.**

---

## ✨ The Solution

This extension automatically decodes LinkedIn's post IDs to reveal **exact timestamps** hidden in plain sight.

### Before → After

| LinkedIn Shows | Extension Reveals |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `2h ago` | `01/13/2026, 1:29:45 PM (2 hours ago)` |
| `3d ago` | `01/10/2026, 9:15:22 AM (3 days ago)` |
| `1w ago` | `01/06/2026, 4:30:10 PM (1 week ago)` |

**Plus:** See time differences in comment threads!
```
Post: 01/13/2026, 8:00:00 AM (5 hours ago)
├─ Comment: 01/13/2026, 8:05:00 AM [5 minutes after post] ← Quick!
└─ Reply: 01/13/2026, 10:30:00 AM [2 hours 30 minutes after post] ← Later
```

## 🔬 How It Works

### The Science Behind It

LinkedIn uses **Snowflake IDs** (like Twitter, Discord, Instagram) to generate unique post identifiers. These 64-bit numbers encode the timestamp directly!

**Example Post ID:**
```
7416739544328249344
```

**Decoding Process:**
1. Convert to binary
2. Shift right by 22 bits
3. Result is Unix timestamp in milliseconds
4. Convert to readable date

```javascript
const id = BigInt("7416739544328249344");
const timestampMs = id >> 22n;
const date = new Date(Number(timestampMs));
// Result: January 13, 2026, 7:15:03 AM UTC
```

**It's not hacking—it's just math!** The timestamp is publicly embedded in every LinkedIn URL.
